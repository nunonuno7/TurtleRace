# Turtle Race

Turtle Race is a Python program that simulates a race between colorful turtles using the Turtle graphics library. Each turtle competes to reach the finish line, and the winner is determined based on the position reached.

## Getting Started

To run the Turtle Race program, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Clone the project repository from GitHub, and ensure that you have the `turtle` library installed. You can install it by running the following command:

pip install turtle


## Usage

1. Open the Python script `turtle_race.py` in a Python IDE or editor.
2. Run the script, and a GUI window will appear.
3. Enter the number of turtles that will compete in the race (1 to 6) in the input dialog box.
4. Make your bet by entering the color of the turtle you think will win the race in the input dialog box.
5. Watch the turtles race towards the finish line. The winning turtle and the race result will be displayed in the console.
6. The GUI window will display a congratulatory message if you win the bet, or a message indicating a loss.


## Acknowledgments
The Turtle Race project was created as a fun exercise to learn Python programming and the Turtle graphics library.
